/// A dependency graph is something that stores a list of named entities. Each entity has a list of dependencies, and
/// these dependencies determine the order that the objects in the dependency graph will be processed.
///
/// This is typically used to control the ordering of third party integrations. If one integration needs to run after or
/// before another, it will add a `before:xyz` or `after:xyz` dependency on the other integration.
///
/// Entities can be added or removed at any point, but this is discouraged because it makes debugging very difficult.
/// Circular dependencies between entities will cause a runtime error and must be avoided.
///
/// An entity may be one of the following:
/// - An object can be any generic java object, and is the primary 'unit'.
/// - A target acts like a systemd target - see [#addTarget(String, String...)].
/// - A subgraph is a nested graph within this graph - see [#addSubgraph(String, String...)].
///
/// Names for entities can be separated by forward slashes, which inserts them into a subgraph instead of the root graph.
/// The subgraph must exist, or an error will be thrown. Subgraphs cannot be made optional. When an entity is inserted
/// into a subgraph, its dependencies are against entities within that subgraph.
/// Example: `inventories/backpacks/[some backpack adapter]`.
